    <h2>Save Soil</h2>
    <p><b>Save Soil </b>is a global movement launched by <STRONG>Sadguru</STRONG>, to address the soil crisis by bringing together people from around the world to stand up for Soil Health, and supporting leaders of all nations to institute national policies and actions toward increasing the organic content in cultivable Soil.Almost every major ecological crisis is, to some degree or form, a consequence or symptom of the degradation of soil. Similarly,almost every environmental or environment-related pain point can be addressed by creating healthy soil.
    It is, in fact, a fallacy to think we can address any one aspect of our environment without addressing the whole, because no aspect of the ecosystem functions in isolation. No solution is complete until we become conscious that life is one single complex phenomenon, all of which is happening in unison. In many ways, Soil is the underlying platform upon which life springs forth. If we fix soil, we have the best chance of fixing the whole.</p>
